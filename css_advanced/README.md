This Get Schooled Website is my delve into learning about some of the useful tools for CSS such as flexbox that I will be using for
the rest of my career.  It is meant to be as close as a duplicate to the original site as best as can be from my skillset.  I definetly
found a few key areas I struggle in such as layering my margins and padding and forcing font swaps.
