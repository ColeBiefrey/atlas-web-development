This project, html_advanced, will act as the bones and tutorial for an ongoing project for
duplicating a website from the ground up.  This will help enchance my knowledge on divs and
organiziation on the html end before we move into figma and CSS.  

One hurdle I ran into was organizing multiple images and how deep the layers of divs can go
and was happy to learn workarounds and solutions to that problem as well as how to organize it in 
the future.
