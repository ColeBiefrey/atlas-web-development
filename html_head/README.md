This is a website meant to give a quick rundown about some fun little facts about me as a person as well as my ability
to put something together, even if its a pink and grey swirl.

This website is built on two simple pages, one being a chunky paragraph and the other an image gallery that you
can swap between, as well as a hotlink to my github.

Building this website let me into googling how to organize columns and rows, so the image gallery,
while basic, is a good stepping stone to my knowledge base and my growth.
