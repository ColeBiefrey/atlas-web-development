		<h2>Little Tidbits</h2>
		<p>Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening.  My name is Cole Kelsey, and I use any pronouns.  My normal hobbies involve playing whatever game
		I am currently hyperfixated on, usually Dead by Daylight, or composing music at a snails pace.  I chose to come to Atlas because I had
		an interest in the field, but also due to my declining health and the schools welcoming and kind accomodations.  It will also allow me
		to continue to work in fields I enjoy without taking on the more laborous tasks I can no longer pull asunder.  I chose full stack as I
		am already learning some back end stuff on the side in a more hobby fashion, and want to be able to broaden my skill set as well as take
		on something that will be both enjoyable but fullfilling as a long term career.  Some fun little tidbits about me is that I actually
		cannot read sheet music very well due to how my brain processes information, and that I actually invented a notary script when I was very
		young that I use to interpet music, otherwise I generally adjust by simply playing by ear or using MIDI constructs.  One other fun fact
		that I can think of off the top of my head is that I used to be a competitive NetBattler back in the Battle Network 6 Era.  I ran an aggresive
		Tomohawk Cross Shove deck.  If you know, you know.</p>
